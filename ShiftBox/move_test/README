1. Prepare on your machine
Run "gem install bundler"
Run "yum install ruby-devel mysql-devel gcc nodejs npm"
If your system is RHEL, maybe there is no nodejs package, pls run the following command:
# yum install nodejs010-nodejs nodejs010-npm
# eval $( scl enable nodejs010 'echo "export PATH=$PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export MANPATH=$MANPATH"' )
# which node
/opt/rh/nodejs010/root/usr/bin/node
# export PYTHONPATH="/opt/rh/nodejs010/root/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages"
# npm install websocket
2. Run "rhc setup" to setup correct domain and upload ssh key
To avoid ssh interaction, add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config
Host *ose*
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    VerifyHostKeyDNS yes
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Please replace "ose" using your domain, and replace value in app.conf according to your environment.
3. Modify rhlogin, password and domain in app.conf according to your values.
4. Run "create_test_data.sh" to create test app, here we are using cross-cover testing strategy, E.g:
non-scalable jbosseap + mysql
scalable jbosseap + postgresql
scalable python-2.6 + hot_deploy + jenkins build
Not test every app and db matrix.
5. Run "pre_check.sh" to validate your app is working well.
6. Run move testing or upgrade testing manually.
   you can use move_gears.sh to create move commands.
   if expect is installed, you also can run move testing with it.
7. Run "move_post_check.sh" or "upgrade_post_check.sh" to validate your app is still working well.
