1. Prepare on your machine
Run "gem install bundler"
Run "yum install ruby-devel mysql-devel gcc nodejs npm"
If your system is RHEL, maybe there is no nodejs package, pls run the following command:
# yum install nodejs010-nodejs nodejs010-npm
# eval $( scl enable nodejs010 'echo "export PATH=$PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export MANPATH=$MANPATH"' )
# which node
/opt/rh/nodejs010/root/usr/bin/node
# export PYTHONPATH="/opt/rh/nodejs010/root/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages"
# npm install websocket
2. Run "rhc setup" to setup correct domain and upload ssh key
To avoid ssh interaction, add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config
Host *ose*
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    VerifyHostKeyDNS yes
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Please replace "ose" using your domain, and replace value in app.conf according to your environment.
3. Run "create_test_data.sh" to create test app, here we are using cross-cover testing strategy, E.g:
non-scalable jbosseap + mysql
scalable jbosseap + postgresql
scalable python-2.6 + hot_deploy + jenkins build
Not test every app and db matrix.
4. Run "pre_check.sh" to validate your app is working well.
5. Run move testing or upgrade testing manually.
6. Run "move_post_check.sh" or "upgrade_post_check.sh" to validate your app is still working well.
